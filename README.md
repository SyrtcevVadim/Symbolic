# What is the SymCalc?
___
SymCalc(Symbolic Caclulations) is a framework for symbolic computations for C++. It supports a wide spread of the common mathematical functions, correctness-check of mathematical expressions, computations of values of mathematical expressions

Framework is easy to learn, has simple enough functionality(so far) but a new possibilities(simplification, differentiation, mathematical expressions with multiple variables and so on) will be added in the future versions!

As a result, i want to cover all school topics and the topics of first(second)-year of university calculus.
