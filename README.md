# What is the *Symbolic*?
___
Symbolic(Symbolic Caclulations) is a framework for symbolic computations for C++. It supports a wide spread of the common mathematical functions, correctness-check of mathematical expressions and the computations of values of mathematical expressions.

Framework is easy to learn, has simple enough functionality(so far) but a new possibilities(`simplification`, `differentiation`, `mathematical expressions with multiple variables`) will be added in the future versions!

As a result, I want to cover all school topics and the topics of the first(second)-year of university calculus. Stay tuned!
